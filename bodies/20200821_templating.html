  When I created this blog I wanted it to be the dirty simplest website I could
  make, this way I could focus on writing and keeping it updated (how's that
  coming along huh?). This is why It's so bare looking, and contains almost no
  javascript (except for mathjax).
</p>
<p>
  I took literally one post for me to realise how impractical my setup was.
  If I wanted to change anything about the layout I had to go back and edit
  every post and the index. Even with the paltry number of posts I had that was
  boring, and my sed skills will only go so far. For me it was clear I needed to
  have a templating engine.
</p>
<p>
  I still wanted to keep my intention of having the least amount of
  dependencies for this blog as possible. I spend a whole day thiking of
  alternatives, and in the end my solution was so shameless I almost proud of
  it.
</p>
<p>
  The templates are just html with bash embedded between double brackets. It
  looks like this.
</p>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;{‎{ echo $TEXT }}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>
  The renderer just replaces each block with whatever comes out of the
  stdout, and I it's comically small.
</p>

<pre>#!/usr/env/bin python3
import re
import sys
from subprocess import check_output

template = open(sys.argv[1]).read()
for block in re.findall(r"{‎{.*}}", template, re.S):
    rendered = check_output(block[2:-2], shell=True).decode("utf-8")
    template = template.replace(block, rendered, 1)
print(template)</pre>

<p>
  That's really all there is to it. If you're curious how you pass data into
  the templates, the answer is environment variables. Yes I'm serious. This is
  how you invoke it.
</p>

<pre>TEXT="Hello, World!" ./render template.html</pre>

<p>
  Macros even come for free, you just invoke the renderer from a template.
</p>

<pre># greeting.html
&lt;p&gt;{‎{ printf "%s, World!" "$GREETING" }}&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    {‎{ GREETING="Hello" ./render greeting.html }}
    {‎{ GREETING="Hi" ./render greeting.html }}
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>
  I feel there's a more important lesson here.
</p>

<p>
  PS: If you're curious how am I scaping all the brackets shown in the examples
  here, I'm not. I'm just adding a zero width space between the first and
  second bracket so the regex won't catch it.
