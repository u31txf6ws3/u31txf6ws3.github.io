        <p>
        Chances are that if you do data analysis in python you use <a>pandas</a>. I'll spare you an introduction
        paragraph about the library, if you're here you probably know what pandas is and is curious to know what
        my advice is. So let me go straight to the point.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            To get better at pandas take it as a chalenge to do your whole data cleaning/transformation using one
            (possibly quite long) sequence of (mostly builtin) method chains.

        <p>
        I find this advice easier to follow when doing exploratory data
        analysis and cleaning on a jupyter notebook. So get ready, because
        you'll be writing <code>.pipe(lambda df:</code> a lot.
        </p>

        If you're not familiar with the term, method chaining is the 

        i like it because it turns into a puzzle that's quite satisfying to solve

        after a while you'll develop a sixth sense about what should and shouldn't be possible to do only builting functino  

        <p>
        Pandas dataframes contain a staggering ammount of functionality, but it's very
        easy to get stuck in a state where you know only the basic functionallity
        that's enough to perform most data transformation and analysis. The problem with that
        is that you end up with messy, fragile and hard to debug code.
        </p>

        <pre>
        df[df.apply(lambda row: row.A in valid)]
        df[df['A'].isin(valid)]
        df.query('A in @valid')
        df.pipe(lambda df: df[df.A.isin(valid)])
        </pre>

        * .pipe
        * never reference the original dataframe
        * Use the `query` dataframe method
        * Plotting
        * Use a `jump` function
        * pipe(jump, display) is your print function

        <h3>Will it make data analysis easier?</h3>
        Definitelly on notebooks

        <h3>Will it make my analysis run faster?</h3>
        Most of the time won't make a difference, other times it will make it slower.

        <h3>Will it make code more readable?</h3>
        Depends, too many lambdas

        <h3>Will it be easier to debug?</h3>
        Well, kinda.
