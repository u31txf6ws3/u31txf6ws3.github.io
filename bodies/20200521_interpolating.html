        <p>This is a quick one, but while converting my <a
            href="./20150904_automata">old cellular automata posts</a> from
        Jupyter Notebooks to HTML I came across this (Python 2) function I wrote five
        years ago.</p>

        <pre>def make_rule(rule_name, k):
    rule_name = int(rule_name)
    rule_len = 2 ** k
    rule = map(int, bin(rule_name)[2:])
    rule = [0] * (rule_len - len(rule)) + rule
    rule = rule[::-1]
    return rule</pre>

        <p>This is just meant to return a list with the \(2^k\) binary
        digits of the integer <code>rule_name</code>, reversed. So we get something
        like</p>

        <pre>>>> make_rule(2, 3)
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</pre>

        <p>I purposefully did not use bit-shifting operations, yet still I
        don't like this code a lot. It has wonky things like</p>

        <pre>bin(rule_name)[2:]</pre>

        <p>Which is there to remove the <code>'0b'</code> that the function <code>bin</code> prefixes to its output.
        If I were writing that today I'd make use of the string format parameter <code>b</code></p>

        <pre>>>> x = 123
>>> f"{x:b}"
'1111011'</pre>

        <p>It's cleaner in my opinion, though admittedly a bit more cryptic if
        you're not used to string formating.</p>

        <p>Then there's this line, which is meant to left pad the resulting
        string with zeros</p>

        <pre>[0] * (rule_len - len(rule)) + rule</pre>

        <p>I knew you could set the minimum number of digits <code>n</code> of a
        number using the formating parameter <code>0n</code>
        <pre>>>> x = 123
>>> f"{x:08}"
'00000123'</pre>
        but I didn't know if you could use both parameters in conjunction
        before writing this post. Turns out you can.</p>

        <pre>>>> x = 123
>>> f"{x:08b}"
'01111011'</pre>

        <p>However in my case the number of digits is variable. I wonder if I'm allowed to...</p>

        <pre>>>> k = 3
>>> x = 123
>>> f"{x:0{2 ** k}b}"
'01111011'</pre>
        
        <p>Oh.</p>
        <p>So I could have written the function more succinctly.</p>

        <pre>def make_rule(rule_name, k):
    n_digits = 2 ** k
    as_binary = f"{rule_name:0{n_digits}b}"
    return [int(i) for i in reversed(as_binary)]</pre>

        <p>Which I think is easier to understand.</p>
